    <h2><b>About Course</b></h2>
    <p> Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application.
        Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of website production as
        opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex,
        responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
